abstract = {The effect of polymer polydispersity on the polymer-induced interaction between colloidal particles due to non-adsorbing ideal chains is investigated. An analytical theory is developed for the polymer segment density between two plates and in the space surrounding two spheres by extending a recently proposed superposition approximation to include polymer polydispersity. {\{}Monte{\}} {\{}Carlo{\}} computer simulations were made to test the validity of the analytical theory. The polymer densities predicted by the superposition approximation are in reasonable agreement with simulation results for the polydisperse case. The simulations show that depletion leads to a size fractionation of the polymers. It is shown that size polydispersity has a small effect on the interaction between two parallel plates but a more significant effect on the interactions between two spheres. The range of the potential increases and the contact potential drops with increasing polydispersity. Polymer-segment density as a function of y for three values of x, as indicated, in the space surrounding two colloidal spheres with radius r = {\{}R{\}}-go and h = 0.48r(go). Symbol are the mc results: polydisperse polymer (o; z = 1) and monodisperse polymer(o) samples. Curves are the predictions of the product-function, approximation for monodisperse polymer (solid lines) and polydisperse polymer(z = 1, dash lines).},

abstract = {We investigated membrane-like polymer structures of fractal connectivity such as Sierpinski gaskets and Sierpinski carpets applying the bond fluctuation model in three dimensions. Without excluded volume (phantom), both polymeric fractals obey Gaussian elasticity on larger scales determined by their spectral dimension. On the other hand, the swelling effect due to excluded volume is rather distinct between the two polymeric fractals: Self-avoiding Sierpinski gaskets can be described using a Flory-type mean-field argument. Sierpinski carpets having a spectral dimension closer to perfect membranes are significantly more strongly swollen than predicted. Based on our simulation results it cannot be excluded that Sierpinski carpets in athermal solvent show a flat phase on larger scales. We tested the self-consistency of Flory predictions using a virial expansion to higher orders. From this we conclude that the third virial coefficient contributes marginally to Sierpinski gaskets, but higher order virial coefficients are relevant for Sierpinski carpets.},

@article{Giupponi2007,
abstract = {Using a molecular dynamics and mean field theory approach which explicitly accounts for free ions, we study the conformation of polyelectrolyte dendrimers for different generation numbers, spacer lengths, charge distributions and ionic strengths. We find that, due to local charge neutrality, electrostatic interactions are strongly screened under all the conditions studied (including salt free conditions). This leads to the cores of the dendrimers being filled and to a very weak dependence of dendrimer conformations on ionic strength. These results are contrary the predictions of Debye-Huckel theory and highlight the limitations of Debye-Huckel theory in modeling the properties of highly charged macromolecular systems. However, our simulations suggest that some responsiveness to ionic strength may be recovered for more weakly charged dendrimers.},

@article{Wiener1994,
abstract = {We have developed a new class of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents with large proton relaxation enhancements and high molecular relaxivities. The reagents are built from the polyamidoamine form of Starburst dendrimers in which free amines have been conjugated to the chelator 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. The dendrimer gadolinium poly-chelates have enhancement factors, i.e., the ratio of the relaxivity per Gd(III) ion to that of Gd(III)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, of up to 6. These factors are more than twice those observed for analogous metal-chelate conjugates formed with serum albumins, polylysine, or dextran. One of the dendrimer-metal chelate conjugates has 170 gadolinium ions bound, which greatly exceeds the number bound to other macromolecular agents reported in the literature, and has a molecular relaxivity of 5,800 (mM.s)-1, at 25 MHz, 20 degrees C, and pH of 7.4. We observed that these dendrimer-based agents enhance conventional MR images and 3D time of flight MR angiograms, and that those with molecular weights of 8,508 and 139,000 g/mole have enhancement half lives of 40 +/- 10 and 200 +/- 100 min, much longer than the 24 +/- 4 min measured for Gd(III)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Our results suggest that this new and powerful class of contrast agents have the potential for diverse and extensive application in MR imaging.},

abstract = {A theory of micellization of A Bdiblock copolymer molecules in a selective solventS is developed here. The micelles are assumed to have a completely segregated core region consisting only of the A block and a shell region consisting of the solventS and the solvent compatible B block. The theory allows one to predict the critical micelle concentration, the micelle size distribution, the average aggregation number, as well as the core radius and the shell thickness of the micelle. The novel outcome of the present theory, in contrast to the treatments of micellization pioneered by de Gennes, Leibler, Orland, and Wheeler, and Noolandi and Hong, is its prediction that the solvent compatible B block plays an important role in determining the micellization behavior. The influence of the B block becomes relatively more prominent in systems where the solventS constitutes a very good solvent for the B block. Further, scaling relations that are not system specific have been developed relating explicitly the micellar size parameters to the characteristics of the block copolymer and the solvent.},

@article{Stechemesser1997,
abstract = {Dendrimer molecules are regularly branched macro-molecules comprised of short multifunctional mono-mers. 1,2 Stepwise synthesis around an initiator core leads to a treelike fractal structure of the polymer. 3 Such structures have been designed from various dendritic precursor components. 4-6 For PAMAM dendrimers, either ammonia or ethylenediamine is used as the core, which results in three or four dendrons growing from the center of the molecule. The following building blocks (so-called generations, g) consist of methyl meth-acrylate and ethylenediamine. There is a growing interest in dedrimeric molecules from a scientific and technical point of view. Dendrim-ers can be viewed as model compounds for self-as-sembling biological systems like vesicles or micellar systems. A potential technical application of these polymers includes nanosize reaction vessels and chemi-cal sensors. Some researchers take dendrimer mol-ecules as subunits to synthesize even more complex supramolecular assemblies. 7 It is known that with increasing generation number a considerable part of the inner surface and volume of the dendrimer molecules is accessible to the solvent. 8 Therefore, it is expected that the dendrimers have a swelling capability (e.g. dependent on the solvent quality), which could be used in separation media and drug delivery systems. 9 There have appeared a number of theoretical studies to describe the detailed molecular structure of dendritic polymers. In a first mean-field model by de Gennes and Hervet 10 it was assumed that successive generations of monomers lie in concentric shells about the core, leading to an onion-like structure. Following coarse-grained kinetic models, 11 Monte Carlo, 12,13 and molecular dy-namics simulations 8,14 on an atomic level have ques-tioned this finding. In general, these investigations indicate that for early generations a high monomer density region appears, where the monomer units exist in a rather stretched conformation, extending from the central core. Higher generations (g {\textgreater} 5) exhibit a significant flexibility, and chain backfolding was ob-served. The monomers of the higher generations can be found in all regions of the dendrimer molecule, including the core region. Very recent predictions from a self-consistent mean-field model are in line with these findings. 15 Murat and Grest 14 have performed a molecular dy-namics study to investigate the effect of solvent quality on the molecular dimensions of dendrimers. The den-sity profile reveals a high-density core domain, followed by a plateau region where the dendron density depends on the solvent quality, being higher under poor solvent conditions. The dendrimer size was found to scale with the number of monomers N as R g ∝ N $\nu$ with $\nu$) 0.33. Their results confirm that monomer segments of later generations do fold back and can occupy the central region of the molecules. Based on a kinetic growth model, Lesanec and Muthukumar 11 have obtained a slightly different scaling exponent with $\nu$) 0.22 (0.02. We have investigated the hydrodynamic properties of PAMAM dendrimers in different solvents by holographic relaxation spectroscopy (HRS). Our main emphasis was to characterize the influence of solvent quality on the molecular dimensions in solution. In addition, we have tested theoretical scaling relationships predicted for these molecules. Experimental Section. The PAMAM dendrimers with an ethylenediamine core were obtained from Poly-science Europe GmbH (g) 6) and Aldrich Chemical Co. (g) 2, 3, 4, 8, 10), and the labeling compound 4-(di-methylamino)-4′-isothiocyanatoazobenzene (DABITC) was purchased from Fluka Chemie GmbH. The unla-beled dendrimer molecules have been characterized by dynamic light scattering. As shown in Figure 1, the intensity autocorrelation function is well represented by a single-exponential decay. The molecular weight distribution was estimated from the variance $\sigma$ of a cumulant and CONTIN analysis, 16,17 respectively. Both methods gave M w /M n e 1.04 (according to M w /M n) 1 + $\sigma$). The dye molecules were chemically attached to the dendrimers in the following way: 100 µL of the 10{\%} methanolic solution of the dendrimer was added to 900 µL of a freshly prepared mixture of 0.3 mg/mL DABITC in methanol. The solution was stirred at room temper-ature for 24 h. After the solvent was evaporated under vacuum, the labeled dendrimer was dissolved in 1.0 mL of the corresponding solvent. The aqueous solution contained 0.1 M NaCl in a Tris buffer at pH 8.0. The labeled dendrimer was purified by gel chromatography using Sephadex 25G. The amount of dye molecules per dendrimer was estimated from UV spectra, assuming the same absorption coefficient for free and attached DABITC dye molecules. The values presented in Table 1 are in good agreement with theoretical label densities as expected from the molar ratio during synthesis. In general, 2-6{\%} of the amino end groups of the PAMAM dendrimer molecules were modified. For the HRS measurements, the samples were diluted to a final concentration of 1.0 mg/mL and filtered through a 0.2},

abstract = {The problem of hydrodynamic turbulence is reformulated as a heat flow problem along a chain of mechanical systems describing units of fluid of smaller and smaller spatial extent. These units are macroscopic but have a few degrees of freedom, and they can be studied by the methods of (microscopic) nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The fluctuations predicted by statistical mechanics correspond to the intermittency observed in turbulent flows. Specifically, we obtain the formula $\zeta$(p)=p/3-1/In$\kappa$ In $\Gamma$(p/3 + 1) for the exponents of the structure functions (left angle bracket|$\Delta$(r)V|(p) right angle bracket {\~{}} r($\zeta$(p)). The meaning of the adjustable parameter $\kappa$ is that when an eddy of size r has decayed to eddies of size r/$\kappa$, their energies have a thermal distribution. The above formula, with (In $\kappa$)⁻¹ = .32 ± .01 is in good agreement with experimental data. This lends support to our physical picture of turbulence, a picture that can thus also be used in related problems.},

abstract = {A fundamental and long-standing problem in polymer physics is to deduce the relationship between the topology of a polymer and its dynamics. Generalized Gaussian structures (GGS), originating from the familiar Rouse model, represent a valuable tool for this purpose. This review summarizes theoretical efforts that have been undertaken in studying the dynamics of polymer systems with complex internal topologies by employing the GGS approach. The dynamic properties of a wide range of polymeric structures (ranging from polymer networks to dendritic and hybrid polymers) are discussed, while emphasizing systems that can be treated analytically (or semi-analytically). These studies provide considerable insight into the problem of relating the structure of a polymer to its dynamics. In many cases the GGS-treatment represents a first step in understanding the dynamics of polymers, and it may serve as a reference point for the development of more realistic models.},

abstract = {Dendrimers are a very special type of hyperbranched polymers, synthesized step by step from a central core, by the repetition of a sequence of reactions. Phosphorus-containing dendrimers, that are dendrimers possessing one phosphorus atom at each branching point, possess numerous properties, most generally due to the presence of multiple functional groups in close proximity, which may induce cooperative effects. Such effect is in particular highly desirable when creating sensors. Indeed, in order to comply with environmental friendly criteria, a sensor must be sensitive, specific, and reusable. The use of phosphorus-containing dendrimers for creating sensors may afford such properties. This review is divided in 4 main headings. The first one concerns the self-diagnosis of the dendritic structure, purity, size and properties; the second one describes the use of these dendrimers as chemical sensors; the third one emphasizes the role of dendrimers for the elaboration of biological sensing devices; and finally the fourth one describes the use of fluorescent dendrimers for biological imaging. Several of these properties are due to the presence of phosphorus at all branching point of these structures.},

abstract = {The bond fluctuationmethodisusedtosimulateboth nonconcatenated entangled and interpenetrating melts of ring polymers. We find that the swelling of interpenetrating rings upon dilution follows the same laws as for linear chains. Knotting and linking probabilities of ring polymers in semidilute solution are analyzed using the HOMFLY polynomial. We find an exponential decay of the knotting probability of rings. The correlation length of the semidilute solution can be used to superimpose knotting data at different concentrations. A power law dependence f n ∼ ϕR2 ∼ ϕ0.77N for the average number f n of linked rings per ring at concentrations larger than the overlap volume fraction of rings ϕ* is determined from the simulation data. The fraction of nonconcatenated rings displays an exponential decay POO ∼ exp(−f n), which indicates f n to provide the entropic effort for not forming concatenated conformations. On the basis of these results, we find four different regimes for the conformations of rings in melts that are separated by a critical lengths NOO, NC, and N*. NOO describes the onset of the effect of nonconcatenation below which topological effects are not important, NC is the crossover between weak and strong compression of rings, and N* is defined by the crossover from a nonconcatenation contribution f n ∼ ϕR2 to an overlap dominated concatenation contribution f n ∼ ϕN1/2 at N {\textgreater} N*. For NOO {\textless} N {\textless} NC, the scaling of ring sizes R ∼ N2/5 results from balancing nonconcatenation with weak compression of rings. For NC {\textless} N {\textless} N*, nonconcatenation and strong compression imply R ∼ N3/8. Our simulation data for noninterpenetrating rings up to N = 1024 are in good agreement with the prediction for weakly compressed rings. I.},

abstract = {We grow AB2 random hyperbranched polymer structures in different ways and using different simulation methods. In particular we use a method of ad hoc construction of the connectivity matrix and the bond fluctuation model on a 3D lattice. We show that hyperbranched polymers split into two universality classes depending on the growth process. For a "slow growth" (SG) process where monomers are added sequentially to an existing molecule which strictly avoids cluster-cluster aggregation the resulting structures share all characteristic features with regular dendrimers. For a "quick growth" (QG) process which allows for cluster-cluster aggregation we obtain structures which can be identified as random fractals. Without excluded volume interactions the SG model displays a logarithmic growth of the radius of gyration with respect to the degree of polymerization while the QG model displays a power law behavior with an exponent of 1/4. By analyzing the spectral properties of the connectivity matrix we confirm the behavior of dendritic structures for the SG model and the corresponding fractal properties in the QG case. A mean field model is developed which explains the extension of the hyperbranched polymers in an athermal solvent for both cases. While the radius of gyration of the QG model shows a power-law behavior with the exponent value close to 4/5, the corresponding result for the SG model is a mixed logarithmic-power-law behavior. These different behaviors are confirmed by simulations using the bond fluctuation model. Our studies indicate that random sequential growth according to our SG model can be an alternative to the synthesis of perfect dendrimers.},

Comparisons to simulation reported here show that the conformations of hyperbranched species, i.e., their radii of gyration and full density profiles, are accurately described by this approach. These stringent tests complement previous tests against experiment. We include the effects of solvent quality at the mean-field level. Our model works best for hyperbranched structures, but also reproduces very well the simulated density profiles of dendrimers. The models reported here provide a simple, but realistic, picture of the physical influences that affect the conformations of hyperbranched species.},

More importantly, such understanding may greatly improve the efficiency of a simulation program. The implementation of simulation methods is illustrated in pseudocodes and their practical use in the case studies used in the text. Since the first edition only five years ago, the simulation world has changed significantly - current techniques have matured and new ones have appeared. This new edition deals with these new developments; in particular, there are sections on: transition path sampling and diffusive barrier crossing to simulaterare events; dissipative particle dynamic as a course-grained simulation technique; novel schemes to compute the long-ranged forces; Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian dynamics in the context constant-temperature and constant-pressure molecular dynamics simulations; multiple-time step algorithms as an alternative for constraints; defects in solids; the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth sampling, recoil-growth, and concerted rotations for complex molecules; and, parallel tempering for glassy Hamiltonians. Examples are included that highlight current applications and the codes of case studies are available on the World Wide Web. Several new examples have been added since the first edition to illustrate recent applications. Questions are included in this new edition. No prior knowledge of computer simulation is assumed.},

abstract = {DNA-grafted nanoparticles have been called "programmable atom-equivalents": Like atoms, they form three-dimensional crystals, but unlike atoms, the particles themselves carry information (the sequences of the grafted strands) that can be used to "program" the equilibrium crystal structures. We show that the programmability of these colloids can be generalized to the full temperature-dependent phase diagram, not just the crystal structures themselves. We add information to the buffer in the form of soluble DNA strands designed to compete with the grafted strands through strand displacement. Using only two displacement reactions, we program phase behavior not found in atomic systems or other DNA-grafted colloids, including arbitrarily wide gas-solid coexistence, reentrant melting, and even reversible transitions between distinct crystal phases.},

abstract = {This review collects and describes experiments that employ colloidal suspensions to probe physics in ordered and disordered solids and related complex fluids. The unifying feature of this body of work is its clever usage of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles. These temperature-sensitive colloidal particles provide experimenters with a 'knob' for in situ control of particle size, particle interaction and particle packing fraction that, in turn, influence the structural and dynamical behavior of the complex fluids and solids. A brief summary of PNIPAM particle synthesis and properties is given, followed by a synopsis of current activity in the field. The latter discussion describes a variety of soft matter investigations including those that explore formation and melting of crystals and clusters, and those that probe structure, rearrangement and rheology of disordered (jammed/glassy) and partially ordered matter. The review, therefore, provides a snapshot of a broad range of physics phenomenology which benefits from the unique properties of responsive microgel particles.},

We examine the sizes, overlaps and effective forces between the centers of mass of the dendrimers with and without added monovalent and divalent salt. For neutral dendrimers, we find that all effective interactions for the various spacer lengths can be scaled on a universal curve. Adding charge to the dendrimers leads to increased repulsions between them, which can be tuned by the spacer length P and become softer as the latter increases. Addition of monovalent salt of various concentrations leads to no visible effects on the effective interaction, in contrast to divalent salts, which cause a dramatic reduction of the effective repulsion as the salinity increases.},

We find that the decrease of the pH value can induce the increase in the effective size of dendrimers and that multivalent counterions can lead to like-charged attraction between dendrimers. Under high-valent counterion conditions, the attractive force between the two dendrimers displays the “M”-like profiles induced by the competition of various interactions. Moreover, short modification of surface does not change their trend of aggregation no matter what the terminal monomers of the dendrimers are. Our results are helpful for designing a novel class of dendrimers to achieve optimal functionalities.},

abstract = {The rheological properties of different generations of hyperbranched polyesters in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone solvent and their blends with a poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) are examined in this study. All the hyperbranched polyester solutions exhibit Newtonian behavior, with steady shear viscosities independent of shear rate. This indicates the absence of physical entanglements in these systems. In addition, solution viscosities are found to be only slightly affected by the different generations of the hyperbranched polymer. The polyesters have very small intrinsic viscosities, and their hydrodynamic radius scales as R h ∼ M 0.39 , suggesting a less packed structure than dendrimers. All generations of the hyperbranched polyesters also show comparable apparent activation energies of flow over the temperature range studied. Replacing linear polymers with hyperbranched polymers causes large reductions in the blend viscosities. This behavior can be attributed to the decrease in both the number of physical entanglements between linear polymers and the blend's intrinsic viscosity upon addition of the hyperbranched polymer.},

abstract = {We study the static and dynamic properties of amphiphilic dendrimers of generation 3 through 7 in an explicitly modeled solvent with molecular dynamics. All interior monomers are solvophobic while the terminal monomers are varied from all solvophobic to all solvophilic, with a number of nonuniform solvophobic/solvophilic terminal monomer arrangements investigated. For generations 6 and 7, crowding at the dendrimer surface forces some solvophilic monomers into the interior of the molecule. The nonuniformly surface-modified dendrimers are studied to examine how different arrangements of terminal monomers might affect dendrimer conformation. In all cases with solvophilic terminal monomers we find the solvophilic monomers congregating at the surface; thus, the dendrimer adopts the form of a unimolecular micelle. For generation 5 and smaller, the terminal monomer arrangement has no effect on the static or dynamic properties. For generations 6 and 7, a minimum number of bonds between the two types of terminal monomers is required to observe all solvophilic terminal monomers at the surface of the molecule. Lowering the simulation temperature, which effectively increases the interaction strength between solvophilic monomers and solvent, eliminates the backfolding tendencies of the solvophilic monomers and increases the asphericity of the generation 6 and 7 dendrimers.},

Upon increasing the dendrimer generation, the effective charge obtained from our SANS experiments only shows a small increase in contrast to the nearly exponential increase predicted by a recent atomic simulation. We also find that with the same degree of molecular protonation the specific counterion association, which is defined as the ratio of bound chloride anions to positively charged amines in solutions, is larger for higher-generation PAMAM dendrimer.

abstract = {The effective pair potentials between different kinds of dendrimers in solution can be well approximated by appropriate Gaussian functions. We find that in binary dendrimer mixtures the range and strength of the effective interactions depend strongly upon the specific dendrimer architecture. We consider two different types of dendrimer mixtures, employing the Gaussian effective pair potentials, to determine the bulk fluid structure and phase behavior. Using a simple mean field density functional theory (DFT) we find good agreement between theory and simulation results for the bulk fluid structure. Depending on the mixture, we find bulk fluid-fluid phase separation (macrophase separation) or microphase separation, i.e., a transition to a state characterized by undamped periodic concentration fluctuations. We also determine the inhomogeneous fluid structure for confinement in spherical cavities. Again, we find good agreement between the DFT and simulation results. For the dendrimer mixture exhibiting microphase separation, we observe a rather striking pattern formation under confinement.},

abstract = {Soft nanocomposites represent both a theoretical and an experimental challenge due to the high number of the microscopic constituents that strongly influence the behaviour of the systems. An effective theoretical description of such systems invokes a reduction of the degrees of freedom to be analysed, hence requiring the introduction of an efficient, quantitative, coarse-grained description. We here report on a novel coarse graining approach based on a set of transferable potentials that quantitatively reproduces properties of mixtures of linear and star-shaped homopolymeric nanocomposites. By renormalizing groups of monomers into a single effective potential between a f -functional star polymer and an homopolymer of length N0, and through a scaling argument, it will be shown how a substantial reduction of the to degrees of freedom allows for a full quantitative description of the system. Our methodology is tested upon full monomer simulations for systems of different molecular weight, proving its full predictive potential.},

abstract = {We study the structure of carboxylic acid terminated neutral poly(propyl ether imine) (PETIM) dendrimer from generations 1-6 (G1-G6) in a good solvent (water) by fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We determine as a function of generation the structural properties such as radius of gyration, shape tensor, asphericity, fractal dimension, monomer density distribution, and end-group distribution functions. The sizes obtained from the MD simulations have been validated by small angle x-ray scattering experiment on dendrimer of generations 2-4 (G2-G4). A good agreement between the experimental and theoretical value of radius of gyration has been observed. We find a linear increase in radius of gyration with the generation. In contrast, Rg scales as approximately Nx with the number of monomers. We find two distinct exponents depending on the generations, x=0.47 for G1-G3 and x=0.28 for G3-G6, which reveal their nonspace filling nature. In comparison with the amine terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer, we find that Rg of Gth generation PETIM dendrimer is nearly equal to that of (G+1)th generation of PAMAM dendrimer as observed by Maiti et al. [Macromolecules 38, 979 (2005)]. We find substantial back folding of the outer subgenerations into the interior of the dendrimer. Due to their highly flexible nature of the repeating branch units, the shape of the PETIM dendrimer deviates significantly from the spherical shape and the molecules become more and more spherical as the generation increases. The interior of the dendrimer is quite open with internal cavities available for accommodating guest molecules, suggesting the use of PETIM dendrimer for guest-host applications. We also give a quantitative measure of the number of water molecules present inside the dendrimer.},

abstract = {A series of new metallodendrimers built around a ruthenium phthalocyanine core has been prepared. Employing a convergent synthetic strategy, pyridine-containing ligands were prepared and then assembled onto the ruthenium phthalocyanine through axial ligand coordination. The growing shell of oligoethylene glycol chains surrounding the lipophilic core allows solubilisation in water. Photophysical studies show that all the metallodendrimers are strongly phosphorescent and the deactivation pathway of their triplet state depends on the medium in which the compounds are dissolved. On one hand, quenching of the triplet state by the dendritic shell is observed and found to be substantially enhanced in aqueous media. On the other, the dendrimer shields the phthalocyanine from oxygen. This notwithstanding, the phthalocyanines are able to generate singlet oxygen in less polar environments such as in CHCl(3) or THF solution, while in water the generation of singlet oxygen is almost completely switched off.},

The calculations are performed for molecules under neutral and low pH conditions. At neutral pH we assume that only the terminal groups of the dendrimers bear positive charges, while at low pH both the terminal groups and the branching units are charged. In our study, the full Coulomb potential and the excluded volume interactions are taken into account explicitly with the reduced temperature $\tau$ as the main simulation parameter. We observe an interplay of condensation of counterions, trapping of counterions inside the dendrimer?s volume and evaporation of counterions into the surrounding solution giving rise to a nonmonotonous electrostatic swelling of the dendrimer with temperature. Decreasing pH leads to higher swelling and stronger spacer-length dependence. At low pH spacer length-scaling cannot be applied and longer spacers shift the maximum of the swelling to lower temperature. To explain the swelling effect we apply a Flory-type argument where both trapped but noncondensed counterions and uncompensated charges due to evaporation of counterions are taken into account. This model properly reflects the swelling behavior with respect to temperature, pH and spacer-length variation, but quantitatively underestimates the swelling effect.

The multiscale transport of charges in these materials (high mobility at short length scales, low mobility at long length scales) is naturally described with our framework. Additionally, the dependence of mobility with electric field and temperature is explained in terms of conformational variability and spatial correlation.

Simulation results on the radius of gyration, structure factor, intermolecular spacing, dendrimer interpenetration, and water penetration are compared with available experimental data, providing a clear concentration dependent molecular picture of PPI dendrimers. It is shown that with increasing concentration the dendrimer volume diminishes accompanied by a reduction of internalized water, ultimately resulting in solvent filled cavities between stacked dendrimers.

This issue is of critical importance since it is now well-established that a specific NP dispersion state is necessary to optimize a desired property of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). This Perspective focuses on one particular approach to controlling NP spatial dispersion, and hence the properties of polymer-based nanocomposites: the use of polymer-grafted NPs. Novel developments over the past decade in synthesis techniques allow us to controllably functionalize NPs with polymer chains. This has ignited considerable interest in this field, leading to significant advances in creating nanocomposites with tunable physical properties. We begin by briefly outlining the various synthetic strategies for functionalizing NPs and then discuss various methods for controllably dispersing them in a polymer matrix.

abstract = {The Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM), an extension of Ferrenberg and Swendsen's Multiple Histogram Technique, has been applied for the first time on complex biomolecular Hamiltonians. The method is presented here as an extension of the Umbrella Sampling method for free-energy and Potential of Mean Force calculations. This algorithm possesses the following advantages over methods that are currently employed: (1) It provides a built-in estimate of sampling errors thereby yielding objective estimates of the optimal location and length of additional simulations needed to achieve a desired level of precision; (2) it yields the “best” value of free energies by taking into account all the simulations so as to minimize the statistical errors; (3) in addition to optimizing the links between simulations, it also allows multiple overlaps of probability distributions for obtaining better estimates of the free-energy differences. By recasting the Ferrenberg–Swendsen Multiple Histogram equations in a form suitable for molecular mechanics type Hamiltonians, we have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of this method by applying it to a test problem of the generation of the Potential of Mean Force profile of the pseudorotation phase angle of the sugar ring in deoxyadenosine.},

The dendrimers possess “reactive end groups” which allow (a) controlled moelcular weight building (monodispersity), (b) controlled branching (topology), and (c) versatility in design and modification of the terminal end groups. Dendrimer synthesis is accomplished by a variety of strategies involving “time sequenced propagation” techniques. The resulting dendrimers grow in a geometrically progressive fashion as shown: Chemically bridging these dendrimers leads to the new class of macromolecules—”starburst polymers” (e.g., (A)n, (B)n, or (C)n).},

Moreover, high ratio of surface groups to molecular volume has made them a promising synthetic vector for gene delivery. Owing to these properties dendrimers have fascinated the researchers in the development of new drug carriers and they have been implicated in many therapeutic and biomedical applications. Despite of their extensive applications, their use in biological systems is limited due to toxicity issues associated with them. Considering this, the present review has focused on the different strategies of their synthesis, drug delivery and targeting, gene delivery and other biomedical applications, interactions involved in formation of drug-dendrimer complex along with characterization techniques employed for their evaluation, toxicity problems and associated approaches to alleviate their inherent toxicity.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The scattering of a diblock copolymer micelle has been simulated using Monte Carlo techniques. The scattering is analyzed using a novel model, where the corona is represented as a dilute/ semidilute polymer solution with a radial profile. This approach decouples the scattering due to interaction and connectivity induced density fluctuations and scattering due to the radial profile of the corona. Three different profiles have been used to fit the simulated corona scattering: a box with a Gaussian tail and two maximum entropy (ME) profiles; chain penetration into the core region is not allowed for any of the profiles. Excellent fits are obtained, especially for a ME profile with three parameters. An excludedvolume parameter and the corona compressibility are obtained and show a strong dependence on surface coverage. The derived expressions for the form factor provides a new approach for analyzing experimental data obtained by neutron or X-ray small-angle scattering for block copolymer micelles with significant intra- and interchain excluded-volume interactions.},

abstract = {The influence of surface modification on the cytotoxicity of PAMAM dendrimers was examined using Caco-2 cells. Dendrimers were modified by conjugating either lauroyl chains or polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2000 onto the surface of cationic PAMAM dendrimers (G2, G3, G4). The cytotoxicity of unmodified dendrimers towards Caco-2 cells was appreciably higher for cationic (whole generation) compared with anionic (half generation) dendrimers and for both types increased with increasing size (generation) and concentration. A marked decrease in the cytotoxicity of cationic PAMAM dendrimers was noted when the surface was modified, with the addition of six lauroyl or four PEG chains being particularly effective in decreasing cytotoxicity. This decrease in cytotoxicity is thought to be due to a reduction/shielding of the positive charge on the dendrimer surface by the attached chains. The cytotoxicity of dendrimer-based delivery systems is likely to be very different from the parent dendrimer. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dendrimers are highly branched and monodisperse macromolecules that display an exact and large number of functional groups distributed with unprecedented control on the dendritic framework. Based on their globular structure, compared to linear polymers of the same molecular weight, dendrimers are foreseen to deliver extraordinary features for applications in areas such as cancer therapy, biosensors for diagnostics and light harvesting scaffolds. Of the large number of reports on dendrimer synthesis only a few have reached commercial availability. This limitation can be traced back to challenges in the synthetic paths including a large number of reaction steps required to obtain dendritic structures with desired features. Along with an increased number of reaction steps come not only increased waste of chemical and valuable starting materials but also an increased probability to introduce structural defects in the dendritic framework. This tutorial review briefly covers traditional growth approaches to dendrimers and mainly highlights accelerated approaches to dendrimers. A special focus capitalizes on the impact of the click chemistry concept on dendrimer synthesis and the promise it has to successfully accomplish highly sophisticated dendrimers, both traditional as well as heterofunctional, in a minimum number of chemical steps. It is clear that accelerated synthetic approaches are of greatest importance as these will encourage the scientific community to synthesize and access dendrimers for specific applications. The final goal of accelerated synthesis is to deliver economically justified dendritic materials for future applications without compromising the environmental perspective.},

abstract = {We report autophobic behavior of end-functionalized polystyrene molecules. By grafting such molecules from a melt onto the surface of a silicon wafer these molecules formed a “brushlike” layer which entropically repelled the nongrafted but otherwise identical molecules. The brush became nonwettable by the same molecules. Thin polystyrene films on top of dense polystyrene brushes were unstable and ruptured as a consequence of long-range van der Waals interactions which tried to make the films thinner. The films dewetted the polymer brush by the growth of cylindrical holes. We investigated this dewetting process in detail as a function of grafting density, which was varied by annealing thin films of end-functionalized molecules for different times. The contact angle formed by the nongrafted molecules on top of the brush, and also the dewetting velocity, increased significantly with increasing grafting density. Neutron reflectometry results showed that the brush layer could be notably penetrated, regardless of the observed dewetting. Implications of these results to the success of block copolymers and end-functionalized molecules for improved adhesion or for stabilization of thin liquid films are discussed.},

abstract = {The addition of non-adsorbing polymer to a colloidal suspension induces an interparticle 'depletion' attraction whose range and depth can be 'tuned' independently by altering the polymer's molecular weight and concentration respectively. Over the past decade, one particularly simple experimental realization of such a mixture has been studied in considerable detail: nearly-hard-sphere particles of poly(methyl methacrylate) and random-coil polystyrene dispersed in simple hydrocarbon solvents (mainly cis -decalin). The simplicity of the system has enabled rather detailed comparison of experimental findings with theory and simulation. Here I review the current understanding of the equilibrium phase behaviour, structure, phase transition kinetics, and metastability of this model colloid–polymer mixture. These findings form a useful reference point for understanding more complex mixtures. Moreover, in some cases, insights gained from studying this model system have relevance beyond soft-condensed-matter physics, e.g. in understanding the liquid state, in controlling protein crystallization, and in elucidating the nature of glasses.},

abstract = {Based on atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the small angle neutron scattering (SANS) intensity behavior of a single generation-4 polyelectrolyte polyamidoamine starburst dendrimer is investigated at different levels of molecular protonation. The SANS form factor, P(Q), and Debye autocorrelation function, $\gamma$(r), are calculated from the equilibrium MD trajectory based on a mathematical approach proposed in this work. The consistency found in comparison against previously published experimental findings (W.-R. Chen, L. Porcar, Y. Liu, P. D. Butler, and L. J. Magid, Macromolecules 40, 5887 (2007)) leads to a link between the neutron scattering experiment and MD computation, and fresh perspectives. The simulations enable scattering calculations of not only the hydrocarbons but also the contribution from the scattering length density fluctuations caused by structured, confined water within the dendrimer. Based on our computational results, we explore the validity of using radius of gyration R(G) for microstructure characterization of a polyelectrolyte dendrimer from the scattering perspective.},

The simulation data are analysed in terms of the de Gennes scaling concepts, describing the crossover from swollen coils in the dilute limit to gaussian coils in semidilute and concentrated solution. The crossover scaling functions for the chain linear dimensions and for the decay of the structure factor are estimated and compared to corresponding theoretical and experimental results in the literature. Also the dynamics of the chains is studied in detail, and evidence for a gradual crossover from the Rouse model to a {\$}D \backslashsim N{\^{}}{\$} law for the diffusion constant is presented. This crossover is consistent with scaling only if a concentration-dependent segmental "friction coefficient" is introduced. Within this framework general agreement between these data, other simulations and experiment is found.},

This paper reports results from systematic investigations of the atomistic structure of ethylenediamine (EDA) cored PAMAM dendrimer up through the 11th generation (294 852 atoms), at which point the strain energy has risen to a point that limits uniform growth of additional layers. Here we report, as a function of generation, structural properties such as radius of gyration, shape tensor, asphericity, fractal dimension, monomer density distribution, solvent accessible surface area, molecular volume, and end group distribution functions, all evaluated from extensive molecular dynamics (MD) at 300 K. We find that the radius of gyration scales as Rg ∼ N1/3 over the entire range of generations, suggesting rather uniform space filling for all generations. Cont...},

In this review we discuss the physics of polymer brush response along with a summary of the techniques used in their synthesis. We then review the various stimuli that can be used to switch brush conformation; temperature, solvent quality, pH and ionic strength as well as the relatively new area of electric field actuation We discuss examples of devices that utilise brush conformational change, before highlighting other potential applications of responsive brushes in real world devices.},

abstract = {The precise stoichiometry required for the acetylation of surface amines of a poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer generation 5 (G5) was verified by using potentiometric titration, gel permeation chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The average number of primary amine groups, absolute molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution of G5 PAMAM were determined by potentiometric titration and GPC. These fundamental parameters were used to design the stoichiometry of an acetylation reaction that yielded acetylation fractions from 0 to 100{\%} of the primary amines on the macromolecule. GPC refractive index detector confirmed that the diameter of the dendrimer related inversely to the degree of acetylation. The acetylated dendrimers do not follow the elution behavior of the conventional polymer molecules most probably because of their spherical shape and polycationic nature. This study clarifies the nature of the acetylation reaction and provides a well-defined acylated macromolecule, which can serve as a scaffold for the development of complex dendrimeric structures.},

It is shown that the bond fluctuation algorithm for a suitable set of allowed bond vectors has the property that due to the excluded volume constraint no crossing of bonds by local motions can occur, and entanglement restrictions thus are fully taken into account. For athermal binary (AB) symmetrical polymer mixtures, the dependence of both self-diffusion coefficient and interdiffusion coefficient on polymer density is obtained, simulating a thin film geometry where a film of polymer A is coated with a film of polymer B. For one density, the dependence of the interdiffusion coefficient on an attractive energy between unlike monomers is also studied. For weak attraction an enhancement of interdiffusion proportional to this energy occurs. For strong attraction, however, a rather immobile tightly bound AB layer forms in the interface which hampers further unmixing.},

abstract = {Small-angle neutron scattering has been applied for structural investigations of amine-terminated poly(propylene imine) dendrimer (Astramol) solutions in D2O as a function of concentration and acidity. The forward scattering, d$\Sigma$/d$\Omega$(Q = 0), decreases progressively by increasing dendrimer concentration due to interdendrimer interference, giving rise to a well-defined interference peak. Upon increasing dendrimer concentration, a shift is observed in the peak position, Qmax, with the empirical scaling relation Qmax ∼ $\phi$0.55±0.05, which is significantly larger than that of a simple packing argument Qmax ∼ $\phi$1/3. At high Q values, all data sets collapse to a single curve, indicating that the internal structure of the dendrimers are unaffected by interactions between neighboring molecules. Upon addition of acid, the dendrimers become charged, giving rise to a pronounced interference peak. These Coulomb interactions can be screened by addition of either excess acid or salts.},

abstract = {G4 PAMAM dendrimers grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of different sizes (M-w = 550 and 5000) and grafting densities (12-94{\%} of surface terminals) were simulated using the coarse-grained (CG) force fields previously developed and reparametrized in this work. Simulations are carried out for G4, G5, and G7 un-PEGylated dendrimers that are either unprotonated, terminally protonated, or protonated on both terminals and interior sites, corresponding to pH values of {\textgreater} 10, 7, and {\textless} 5, respectively. As protonation increases, simulations show only a small (similar to 6{\%} for G4 and G5) change of dendrimer radius of gyration R-g and show a structural transition from dense-core to dense-shell structure, both of which are in agreement with recent scattering experiments and all-atom simulations. For the PEGylated dendrimers, the R-g of the fully PEG(M-w = 5000)-grafted dendrimer also agrees well with experiment. Longer PEG chains with higher grafting density yield PEG PEG crowding, which stretches dendrimer terminals toward water more strongly, leading to larger size and a dense-shell structure of the dendrimer. Long PEG chains at high grafting densities also penetrate into the dendrimer core, while short ones do not, which might help explain the reduced encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds seen experimentally in dendrimers that are 75{\%}-grafted with long PEG's (M-w = 5000). This reduced encapsulation for dendrimers with long grafted PEG's has previously been attributed to PEG-induced dendrimer aggregation, but this explanation is not consistent with our previous simulations which showed no aggregation even with long PEG's but is consistent with the new simulations reported here that show PEG penetration into the core of the dendrimer to which the PEG is attached.},

abstract = {We consider stress relaxation in a strongly segregated lamellar mesophase, where block copolymers are in the " brush " state with junction points confined to the interface between the adjacent lamellae and blocks stretched out away from it. If the molecular weight of the blocks is large enough, they entangle with their neighbors as well as with blocks from the opposite brush. The number of entanglements of one particular chain with the opposite brush varies from chain to chain even in the monodisperse system. We demonstrate that this dispersion of the number of entanglements leads to a very broad spectrum of relaxation times and to an effectively power-law-like stress relaxation function log G -(log t) " with CY = 1/2 (a = 2) in the strong (weak) chain-stretching limit. We analyze various disentanglement mechanisms for diblocks and triblocks and the onset of the diffusion of copolymers along the interface. Another relaxation mechanism is due to the displacement of a block across the interface into the " enemy " phase. We conclude that for highly entangled copolymers it will be an important mode of stress relaxation (especially for triblock copolymers). For asymptotically long times the relaxation of stress along the perfectly ordered lamella will be liquidlike. In a system with defects in domain structure the relaxation of stress is controlled by the processes of equilibration of excess density along the layers. For the lamellar mesophase we found G (t) -t 4. 2, while for the cylindrical mesophase, G (t) -t},

Here we briefly review recent efforts in direct measurement of depletion forces mediated by nanofluids, as well as a number of related studies on the phase transition in binary colloid mixtures with large size and shape asymmetry, a process in which depletion forces play an important role. We will also discuss the often under-appreciated importance of depletion forces mediated by proteo-nanofluids (liquids containing proteins) in facilitating cellular organisation. Some challenges and outstanding questions will emerge from the above discussions, as briefly summarised.},

abstract = {Conjugated polymer chains have many degrees of conformational freedom and interact weakly with each other, resulting in complex microstructures in the solid state. Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Self-consistent-field (SCF) calculations are presented of a planar grafted polymer layer that interacts either with free polymer chains or with another grafted layer. Three different systems are studied. The first is a grafted polymer layer immersed in a polymer solution. The interaction between grafted and free polymer can significantly influence the grafted polymer volume fraction profile. For grafted chains that are strongly stretched the lattice calculations are compared with the theory of Zhulina, Borisov, and Brombacher (Macromolecules 1991,24,4679). Good agreement is found when the free chain length is far smaller than the grafted chain length. The scaling behavior of the penetration of free polymer into the grafted layer is also studied for this system. In the second type of system the interaction between two grafted layers in the absence of free polymer is considered. The lattice calculations agree well with the theory of Zhulina et al. In the third system free polymer is present between the interacting grafted layers. If this free polymer has a small chain length, ita main effect on the interaction free energy is the compression of the free grafted layers, and only repulsion is found. However, for larger chain lengths a depletion attraction between the grafted layers appears. 1.},

The polymers were polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers of generations 1, 2, and 4 and benzyl ether dendrimers with different end groups (aromatic rings, dodecyl chains, methyl ester groups, perfluoroalkyl chains) of generations 2 to 6, and two series of benzyl ether linear polymers that are analogues of the dendrimers. Solvents were acetone, acetonitrile, chloroform, cyclohexane, methanol, n-pentane, n-propylamine, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene. The temperature range was 35 to 89 degrees C. The amount of solvent absorbed by the dendrimers depends, sometimes strongly, on the kind of dendrimer end groups. The relation between solvent absorption and dendrimer generation number, or molecular weight, depends on the solvent-dendrimer system and on temperature. Solvent absorption in linear polymers is below that for corresponding dendrimers, all or in part owing to crystallinity in the linear polymers.},

@article{Sommer2013,
abstract = {Using Monte Carlo simulations based on the bond fluctuation model we study the adsorption of starburst dendrimers with flexible spacers onto a flat surface. The calculations are performed for various generation number G and spacer length S in a wide range of the reduced temperature $\tau$ as the measure of the interaction strength between the monomers and the surface. Our simulations indicate a two-step adsorption scenario. Below the critical point of adsorption, $\tau$c, a weakly adsorbed state of the dendrimer is found. Here, the dendrimer retains its shape but sticks to the surface by adsorbed spacers. By lowering the temperature below a spacer-length dependent value, $\tau$*(S) {\textless} $\tau$c, a step-like transition into a strongly adsorbed state takes place. In the flatly adsorbed state the shape of the dendrimer is well described by a mean field model of a dendrimer in two dimensions. We also performed simulations of star-polymers which display a simple crossover-behavior in full analogy to linear chains. By analyzing the order parameter of the adsorption transition, we determine the critical point of adsorption of the dendrimers which is located close to the critical point of adsorption for star-polymers. While the order parameter for the adsorbed spacers displays a critical crossover scaling, the overall order parameter, which combines both critical and discontinuous transition effects, does not display simple scaling. The step-like transition from the weak into the strong adsorbed regime is confirmed by analyzing the shape-anisotropy of the dendrimers. We present a mean-field model based on the concept of spacer adsorption which predicts a discontinuous transition of dendrimers due to an excluded volume barrier. The latter results from an increased density of the dendrimer in the flatly adsorbed state which has to be overcome before this state is thermodynamically stable.},

abstract = {A new class of water-soluble, amphiphilic star block copolymers with a large number of arms was prepared by sequential atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) and poly( ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA). As the macroinitiator for the ATRP, a 2-bromoisobutyric acid functionalized fourth-generation hyperbranched polyester (Boltorn H40) was used, which allowed the preparation of star polymers that contained on average 20 diblock copolymer arms. The synthetic concept was validated by AFM experiments, which allowed direct visualization of single molecules of the multiarm star block copolymers. DSC and SAXS experiments on bulk samples suggested a microphase-separated structure, in agreement with the core-shell architecture of the polymers. SAXS experiments on aqueous solutions indicated that the star block copolymers can be regarded as unimolecular micelles composed of a PBMA core and a diffuse PPEGMA corona. The ability of the polymers to encapsulate and release hydrophobic guests was evaluated using H-1 NMR spectroscopy. In dilute aqueous solution, these polymers act as unimolecular containers that can be loaded with up to 27 wt {\%} hydrophobic guest molecules.},

Our simulations support the dense-core picture of dendrimers due to a substantial decrease of monomer densities with the radial distance from the dendrimers' center of mass. The interior of dendrimers is penetrated by the terminal groups due to finite values of the end-group densities in that area indicating backfolding of the terminal groups toward the molecules' interior. The mean instantaneous shape of dendrimers changes monotonously from oblate to spherical as the increase in their molecular weight N is caused by an increase in G, while for fixed G it is hardly affected by variations of S.

Even so we predict a dramatic change in the conformation. The ion pairing in the low pH form leads to a locally compact dense shell with an internal surface area only 37{\%} of the high pH form with a dense core. This transformation from "dense core" at high pH to "dense shell" at low pH could facilitate the encapsulation and release of guest molecules (e.g., drugs) using pH as the trigger, making dendrimers a unique drug delivery vehicle.},

abstract = {We use Langevin dynamics simulations and Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model (PRISM) theory to study polymer grafted nanoparticles specifically to explain the impact of comb polymer architecture on the grafted layer structure and effective interparticle interactions in solvent and in matrix polymer. First, we use simulations to study a single particle grafted with comb polymers with varying comb polymer design (i.e., spacing and length of side chains along the comb polymer backbone), grafting density (i.e., polymer chains/particle surface area), and particle curvature in implicit solvent at the athermal limit. We find that increasing side chain length or decreasing side chain spacing along the comb polymer effectively swells and extends the polymer backbone due to the increasing side chain monomer crowding. For particles at finite curvature with increasing side chain monomer crowding, the monomer concentration profile of the comb polymer backbone at short distances from the surface resembles the concentration profile of a semiflexible linear polymer and at farther distances resembles that of flexible linear polymers grafted to a flat surface. As the particle curvature decreases to zero (i.e., flat surface), increasing side chain crowding has a simpler effect of expanding the grafted layer without changing the overall shape of the concentration profile. To understand how architecture affects the interactions of the comb polymer grafted particles, we use PRISM theory to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) between comb polymer grafted particles in implicit solvent, explicit solvent, and explicit matrix of athermal linear polymers. On the basis of the PMFs calculated for a wide range of design parameters (grafting density, comb polymer design), we find that, compared to linear polymers, the comb polymers exhibit stronger effective attraction in the PMF between the grafted particles in both small molecule solvent and polymer matrix due to the increased crowding in the grafted layer from the comb polymer side chains. Interestingly, the PMF between the grafted particles in a small molecule solvent is more sensitive to the comb polymer design (i.e., side chain length and spacing) than the PMF between the grafted particles in a polymer matrix.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations using the Kremer-Grest model were performed to study polymer brush bilayers formed by end-grafted star polymers in equilibrium and their response to stationary shear motion (nonequilibrium). In unperturbed star brushes of high graftng densities a previously observed two population structure is verified. Star polymers in the brush either belong to a fraction with strongly stretched stem and upward pointing free arms or to a retracted fraction with weakly extended arms. When two opposing brushes are compressed against each other, they form a polymer brush bilayer. Sufficient compression leads to a reduction, up to a disappearance, of the inner divide into two populations in each brush. For systems at stationary shear we could connect the microscopic conformational response to the macroscopic shear force response. Beyond the Newtonian regime the bilayers show a shear thinning behavior with a power law dependence on theWeissenberg number. The exponent of this power law is comparable to the theoretical prediction for sheared polymer brush bilayers formed by linear chains but tends toward slightly higher values at higher star functionalities.

abstract = {We describe a method for locating clusters of geometrically similar conformers in ensembles of chemical conformations. We first calculate the pairwise interconformational distance matrix in either torsional or Cartesian space and then use an agglomerative, single-link clustering method to define a hierarchy of clusterings in the same space. Especially good clusterings are distinguished by high values of the separation ratio: the ratio of the shortest intercluster distance to the characteristic threshold distance defining the clustering. We also discuss other statistics. The method has been embodied in a program called XCluster, which can display the distance matrix, the hierarchy of clusterings, and the clustering statistics in a variety of formats. XCluster can also write out the clustered conformations for subsequent or simultaneous viewing with a molecular visualization program. We demonstrate the sorts of insight that this approach affords with examples obtained from conformational search and molecular dynamics procedures.},

abstract = {Hyperbranched polymers have recently received extensive interest for applications as polymer processing aids (PPAs). In this work, we present the first study on the performance of novel hyperbranched polyethylene as a processing aid for a metallocene linear-low-density polyethylene (mLLDPE). Moreover, we investigated for the first time the unique role that chain topology plays in determining the efficiency of the polymers as PPA. Two polymers of drastically different chain topologies, a hyperbranched polyethylene (HBPE) and a linear branched polyethylene (LBPE) having a linear chain topology, were prepared by ethylene polymerization using chain walking Pd-diimine catalysis. The performances of these two polymers of different chain topologies in improving the processability of the mLLDPE were investigated and compared by using two-step capillary extrusion experiments, including constant-shear testing at 200 s-1 and shear-rate sweep testing. For comparison purposes, a commercial fluoropolymer-based PPA, Viton Free Flow Z100, together with a polyethylene wax sample, were also evaluated for their performances. It was found that, at a concentration 3 wt{\%}, the presence of HBPE in mLLDPE significantly reduced the apparent shear stress, improved extrudate surface morphology, and postponed the onset shear rate for sharkskin instability. However, LBPE did not improve the processability of mLLDPE and it worked merely as a plasticizer, slightly reducing the viscosity of polymer melts. Morphology studies conducted on the cross sections of the blends showed that chain topology greatly affected the polymer additive's miscibility with mLLDPE; the mLLDPE/HBPE blend was a phase-separated system, whereas LBPE appeared to be miscible with mLLDPE. The hyperbranched polymer, HBPE, forms phase-separated droplets, which can migrate to the die surface and form a lubricating layer promoting extrudate slippage. By identifying the effect of chain topology on the polymers' performance, this work may provide a chain-topology guideline for designing polymer-based processing aids. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Society of Rheology.},

In our investigation, the primary focus is to elucidate the effect of counterion valence on the counterion association and its impact on the intramolecular density profile within a dendrimer. In the range of our study for molecular protonation, a strong dependence of the structural properties of charged dendrimers on counterion valence is revealed. Our findings indicate that the association of a large amount of divalent counterions significantly reduces the effective charge of a dendrimer molecule. Surprisingly, no discernible transition of the density distribution profile is observed for the dendrimer charged by D 2 SO 4 , as opposed to our previous observation of a pronounced transition in intramolecular density profile for the dendrimer charged by DCl. These findings may be understood from the thermodynamic processes of counterions.},

At low grafting densities, the melt dewets; at intermediate grafting densities the liquid of free chains wets the brush. On further increasing the grafting density we encounter dewetting (autophobicity).

abstract = {We discuss a phenomenological, coarse-grained simulation scheme, single-chain-in-mean-field (SCMF) simulation, for investigating the kinetics of phase separation in dense polymer blends and mixtures of polymers and solvents. In the spirit of self-consistent-field calculations, we approximate the interacting multichain problem by that of a single chain in an external field, which, in turn, depends on the local densities of the components. To study the time evolution of the mixture, we perform an explicit Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of an ensemble of independent chains in the external field and periodically calculate the average densities and update the external field. Unlike dynamic self-consistent-field theory, these SCMF simulations do not assume that the chain conformations relax much more quickly than the density and incorporate the single-chain dynamics explicitly rather than via an Onsager coefficient. This allows us to study systems with large spatial inhomogeneities and dynamic asymmetries. To assess the accuracy and limitations of the simulation scheme, we compare the results of SCMF simulations using a discretized Edwards Hamiltonian with computer simulations of the corresponding multichain system for (1) the early stages of spinodal decomposition of a symmetric binary polymer blend in response to a quench from chi N = 0.314 to chi N = 5 (where X is the Flory-Huggins parameter and N is the number of segments), for which the growth rate of composition fluctuations is compared with MC simulations of the bond fluctuation model and alternative dynamic self-consistent-field calculations, and (2) the evaporation of a solvent from a lowmolecular-weight thin polymer film, for which a comparison is made with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a bead-necklace model with a monomeric solvent. In the latter case, the polymer conformations are extracted from MD simulations and modeled in the SCMF simulations by a discretized Edwards Hamiltonian augmented by a chain-bending potential. From the MD simulations of thin polymer films in equilibrium with its vapor, phase coexistence has been determined, and the second- and third-order virial coefficients in the SCMF simulations have been adjusted accordingly. Finally, MD simulations of bulk solutions of a polymer and a solvent over a range of compositions, as well as the pure solvent at various densities, have been performed to determine self-diffusion coefficients that enter the SCMF simulations in the form of density-dependent segmental mobilities. A comparison of the polymer and solvent profiles in a thin film as a function of time and the fraction of the solvent evaporating from a solvent-swollen film, as obtained from MD simulations and parameterized SCMF simulations, shows satisfactory agreement for this simple mapping procedure.

For all the generations studied, we find that the radius of gyration R(g) collapses significantly (factor of 2) going from athermal to extreme poor solvent conditions, indicating that varying solvent quality is an effective means of controlling dendrimer size. We also find that in athermal, theta, and extreme poor solvent conditions, the radius of gyration of dendrimers scales with the total number of monomers roughly as R(g) approximately N(1/3). However, a more careful analysis shows that in athermal and theta solvents, there is, in fact, a small but systematic deviation of R(g) from R(g) approximately N(1/3) scaling and the simulation data is described better by the Flory theory prediction of R(g) approximately N(1/5)[(g+1)m](2/5) in athermal solvents and R(g) approximately N(1/4)[(g+1)m](1/4) in theta solvents. We also find for our simulation data that stronger deviations from constant density scaling are possible, with scaling behavior as shallow as R(g) approximately N(0.26) possible for solvent conditions in between theta and the completely collapsed state. It is evident therefore that dendrimers do not obey (or even approximately obey) R(g) approximately N(1/3) scaling under all solvent conditions. Under all solvent conditions, we find that the intramolecular density is dense corelike (i.e., the density maximum is in the interior of the dendrimer) and terminal groups are delocalized throughout the dendrimer.},

The physical origin of this and the associated effects, as well as a mapping of the mixtures onto a one-component system, are discusssed.},

abstract = {Hyperbranched polymers show an outstanding potential for applications ranging from chemistry over nanotechnology to pharmacy. In order to take advantage of this potential, the underlying phase behaviour must be known. From the thermodynamic point of view, the modelling of these phase diagrams is quite challenging, because the thermodynamic properties depend on the architecture of the hyperbranched polymer as well as on the number and kind of present functional end groups. The influence of architecture can be taken into account via the lattice cluster theory (LCT) as an extension of the well-known Flory–Huggins theory. Whereas the Flory–Huggins theory is limited to linear polymer chains, the LCT can be applied to an arbitrary chain architecture. The number and the kind of functional groups can be handled via the Wertheim perturbation theory, applicable for directed forces between the functional groups and the surrounding solvent molecules. The combination of the LCT and the Wertheim theory can be established for the modelling or even prediction of the liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) of polymer solutions in a single solvent or in a solvent mixture or polymer blends, where the polymer can have an arbitrary structure. The applied theory predicts large demixing regions for mixtures of linear polymers and hyperbranched polymers, as well as for mixtures made from two hyperbranched polymers. The introduction of empty lattice sites permits the theoretical investigation of pressure effects on phase behaviour. The calculated phase diagrams were compared with own experimental data or to experimental data taken from literature.},

abstract = {In the recent years, protein PEGylation has become an established and highly refined technology by moving forward from initial simple random coupling approaches based on conjugation at the level of lysine ??-amino group. Nevertheless, amino PEGylation is still yielding important conjugates, currently in clinical practice, where the degree of homogeneity was improved by optimizing the reaction conditions and implementing the purification processes. However, the current research is mainly focused on methods of site-selective PEGylation that allow t*he obtainment of a single isomer, thus highly increasing the degree of homogeneity and the preservation of bioactivity. Protein N-terminus and free cysteines were the first sites exploited for selective PEGylation but currently further positions can be addressed thanks to approaches like bridging PEGylation (disulphide bridges), enzymatic PEGylation (glutamines and C-terminus) and glycoPEGylation (sites of O- and N-glycosylation or the glycans of a glycoprotein). Furthermore, by combining the tools of genetic engineering with specific PEGylation approaches, the polymer can be basically coupled at any position on the protein surface, owing to the substitution of a properly chosen amino acid in the sequence with a natural or unnatural amino acid bearing an orthogonal reactive group. On the other hand, PEGylation has not achieved the same success in the delivery of small drugs, despite the large interest and several studies in this field. Targeted conjugates and PEGs for combination therapy might represent the promising answers for the so far unmet needs of PEG as carrier of small drugs. This review presents a thorough panorama of recent advances in the field of PEGylation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The directly measured polymer-induced depletion forces are well described with a scaling model in which the attraction between particles is caused by the depletion of concentration blobs and thus independent of the length of the polymer chains. We find strong evidence for a repulsive barrier which arises when the distance between the particles is of the order of the correlation length of the solution and which can be interpreted as a packing effect of concentration blobs. Interestingly, the scaling picture can be extended into the regime in which higher virial coefficients of the polymer solution become relevant. We derive a universal relation between the attraction force at the particle contact, f (0), and the osmotic pressure  as f (0) ∼ 2/3, demonstrating its validity over a wide range of concentrations of the polymer solution.},

abstract = {Semiflexible polymers end-grafted to a repulsive planar substrate under good solvent conditions are studied by scaling arguments, computer simulations, and self-consistent field theory. Varying the chain length N, persistence length lp, and grafting density $\sigma$g, the chain linear dimensions and distribution functions of all monomers and of the free chain ends are studied. Particular attention is paid to the limit of very small $\sigma$g, where the grafted chains behave as "mushrooms" no longer interacting with each other. Unlike a flexible mushroom, which has a self-similar structure from the size (a) of an effective monomer up to the mushroom height (h/a ∝ N(v), $\nu$ ≈ 3/5), a semiflexible mushroom (like a free semiflexible chain) exhibits three different scaling regimes, h/a ∝ N for contour length L = Na {\textless} lp, a Gaussian regime, h/a ∝ (Llp)(1/2)/a for lp ≪ L ≪ R* ∝ (lp(2)/a), and a regime controlled by excluded volume, h/a ∝ (lp/a)(1/5)N($\nu$). The semiflexible brush is predicted to scale as h/a ∝ (lpa$\sigma$g)(1/3)N in the excluded volume regime, and h/a ∝ (lpa(3)$\sigma$(2))(1/4)N in the Gaussian regime. Since in the volume taken by a semiflexible mushroom excluded-volume interactions are much weaker in comparison to a flexible mushroom, there occurs an additional regime where semiflexible mushrooms overlap without significant chain stretching. Moreover, since the size of a semiflexible mushroom is much larger than the size of a flexible mushroom with the same N, the crossover from mushroom to brush behavior is predicted to take place at much smaller densities than for fully flexible chains. The numerical results, however, confirm the scaling predictions only qualitatively; for chain lengths that are relevant for experiments, often intermediate effective exponents are observed due to extended crossovers.},

A special role of the individual sugar units attached to the dendritic scaffolds and their density is identified, which govern ionic and H-bond interactions, and biological targeting, but to a large extent are also responsible for the significantly reduced toxicity of the dendritic glycopolymers compared to their polyamine scaffolds. Thus, the application of dendritic glycopolymers in drug delivery systems for gene transfection but also as therapeutics in neurodegenerative diseases has great promise.},

abstract = {Effects of excluded volume interaction on the form factor of a block copolymer micelle model have been investigated by performing Monte Carlo simulations. The micelles are modeled as a corona of semi-flexible chains tethered to a spherical core. Simulated form factors are analyzed using the model proposed by Pedersen and Gerstenberg. A slightly modified model is presented, in which chains consists of a radially pointing rigid rod, onto which a Gaussian chain is attached. The straight section emulates chain stretching near the micelle core. Both models are fitted to the simulation data using two parameters, that describes the individual chains: the radius of gyration, and the average center-of-mass distance to the micelle core. Based on a comparison between parameters obtained from fits, and those obtained directly from the simulation, it is concluded that the models provide good estimates for the radius of gyration and the chain center-of-mass distance for a low surface coverage, while systematic deviations are observed for high surface coverage, where chains begin to overlap, and excluded volume interactions becomes significant},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Conformational properties of neutral and charged dendrimers in dilute solutions of different quality have been investigated by a mean-field analytical approach and by Brownian dynamics (BD) computer simulation for systems up to generation six. Radial monomer distribution and mass distribution functions, radii of gyration, and structure factors have been studied as functions of solvent quality, effective charge of the terminal groups, and Debye screening radius. For high-generation dendrimers BD simulations show that the dendrimers hardly fluctuate. Swelling of both neutral and charged dendrimers is reasonably described by a generalized Flory mean-field theory in which the two-body virial term is replaced by the sum of the excluded-volume and two-body attraction terms. A non-Gaussian term taking into account the finite extensibility of spacers and a Coulomb term in the form of the Debye-Hu¨ ckel approximation have been included as well. The {\~{o}}-point for a single dendrimer molecule is defined as the characteristic energy of the excluded-volume interactions when the linear expansion factor R is equal to unity. In contrast to linear polymers, the {\~{o}}-point defined in such way is different from that calculated as the characteristic energy when scaling relation for a good-solvent conditions stops to be valid. Dendritic terminal groups are distributed through the whole volume of the molecule, but the maximum of this distribution is shifted toward the periphery with increase of Debye screening radius and effective charge of a terminal group. It is shown that fractal dimension of a neutral dendrimer depends on both its generation number and spacer length.},

The wall is$\backslash$ncharacterized by a certain "free energy of sticking", $\gamma$1, which$\backslash$nis negative for adsorption and positive for a repulsive surface.$\backslash$nWe are concerned with the case where $\gamma$1 (per monomer) is small,$\backslash$nbut where the energy per chain is large. (1) For the attractive case$\backslash$n(with a good solvent), we find a remarkable, self-similar form for$\backslash$nthe profile which is essentially independent of the bulk concentration.$\backslash$nMost monomers are confined in a region of thickness D ∼ |$\gamma$1|-3/2.$\backslash$nBut the "equivalent hydrodynamic thickness", eH, is controlled by$\backslash$nthe longest loops and should scale like the coil size in solution,$\backslash$nRF. (2) We also extend these considerations to metastable adsorption.$\backslash$nFor instance, starting from the above situation, we assume that the$\backslash$npolymer in solution is washed out, leaving an adsorption layer; then$\backslash$nthe solvent is cooled down to a $\theta$ point: the adsorption layer shrinks$\backslash$nsignificantly. In particular, we predict that all large loops disappear.$\backslash$nAll results now depend on the sample history: if the layer would$\backslash$nhave been prepared by contact between a $\theta$ solvent and the wall,$\backslash$nwe would expect eH comparable to the $\theta$ solvent coil size. (3) For$\backslash$nthe repulsive case, the exponents describing the depletion layer$\backslash$nhad been constructed earlier through a tentative argument based on$\backslash$nthe osmotic pressure near the wall. We rederive these exponents here$\backslash$nby a more direct scaling method. For all these cases, we construct$\backslash$nthe scaling form of the interfacial tension and check the associated$\backslash$nGibbs identities. {\textcopyright} 1981 American Chemical Society.},

This formula results from a formal first order perturbation calculation without rigorous justification. A rigorous derivation of Fourier's law for heat conduction from the laws of mechanics remains thus a major unsolved problem. In this note we present a deterministic mechanical model of a heat-conducting chain with nontrivial interactions, where kinetic energy fluctuations at the nodes of the chain are removed. In this model the derivation of Fourier's law can proceed rigorously.},

For layers of height h and poly- merization index N we show that interpenetration is confined to distances [ of order (h/R")-1/3, which becomes much smaller than h itself. We show by self-consistent field methods that the concentration of penetrating monomers falls off with penetration depth y as exp(-({\~{}}/[){\~{}}/{\~{}}). time for sliding stress grows exponentially as a fractional power of the molecular weight because of this small interpenetration.

abstract = {Dendritic multiarm copolymers, including dendrimer multiarm copolymers and hyperbranched multiarm copolymers, have shown great potential to be excellent precursors in self-assembly, and many impressive supramolecular structures have been prepared through the solution self-assembly of them. However, the corresponding theoretical studies on the self-assembly mechanism have been greatly lagging behind. Herein, we report the micellization behaviors of amphiphilic dendritic multiarm copolymers with a hydrophobic dendritic core and many hydrophilic arms by dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Both the self-assembly mechanisms and the dynamic self-assembly processes for the formation of unimolecular micelles, microphase-separated small micelles, and large multimolecular micelles have been disclosed through the simulations. Most importantly, the work has proved the large multimolecular micelles are a kind of multimicelle aggregate (MMA) with two formation mechanisms. One is called the unimolecular micelle aggregate (UMA) mechanism, which describes the formation of large multimolecular micelles from direct aggregation of unimolecular micelles; the other is called the small micelle aggregate (SMA) mechanism, which shows that the dendritic multiarm copolymers first self-assemble into small micelles and then the small micelles further aggregate into large multimolecular micelles. In addition, the microphase separation model of the dendritic multiarm copolymers as well as the effects on the formations of UMAs and SMAs are also discussed. These simulation results agree well with experimental observations, and have extended the understanding of the micellization process of dendritic multiarm copolymers.},

The chains are immersed either in a pure (good) solvent or in a solution of the same polymer (P monomers per mobile chain, volume fraction 4). It is assumed that the polymer does not adsorb on the wall surface. The zone occupied by the grafted chain may contain a large fraction of mobile P chains: we call this a mixed case (M), as opposed to the unmixed case (UM). Also the chains may be stretched (S) or unstretched (US). The combination of these two criteria gives four possible regimes. Using scaling laws, we locate the domains of existence of these four regimes in terms of the variables u and 6. High u values may be hard to reach by grafting but could be obtained with block copolymers at an interface between two immiscible solvents.},

The intramolecular swelling is concentrated in the core region, the individual dendra, sub-dendra, etc., being stretched outward with relatively little inter-dendron mixing. Appropriate reduced variables are found for the characteristic radii, which yield a unique master curve for any generation and solvent quality.

By combining large scale computer simulations using the bond fluctuation model with scaling arguments we identify the semi-dilute regime of dendrimers which is controlled by the concentration behavior of the linear spacers. Associated with this observation we find that the decrease in the size of flexible dendrimers is accompanied by increasing interpenetration between the molecules with increasing concentration of the solution. In the melt state we show that the size of individual dendrimers follows the scaling prediction for isolated dendrimers at the $\theta$-point rather than that of collapsed dendrimers. The pair correlation functions between the centers of dendrimers indicate that for short spacers dendrimer solutions retain the morphological characteristics of simple liquids. For long spacers the functions reveal high penetration of neighboring dendrimers in the melt state. Our studies show that flexible dendrimers in solution can be understood with arguments similar to those of linear polymers. The role of generation is to influence the particular form of the crossover-function.},

abstract = {Dispersing nanoparticles in a polymer matrix is intrinsically challenging because of unfavorable entropic interactions between the matrix and the nanoparticle. Similar to suspensions of larger colloidal particles, it has been found that thermodynamically stable dispersions of nanoparticles can be achieved in polymer matrices when the nanoparticles are decorated with dense layers of polymer tethers whose molecular weight is comparable to or greater than that of the matrix. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, in contrast to larger colloidal particles, repulsive interactions between nanoparticles can be achieved with tethered polymers much shorter than the polymer matrix when relatively sparse grafting is employed.},

The frequency dependences of the dielectric and NMR relaxation were obtained and studied in detail. The main contribution to the maxima of these dependences is given by the pulsation process. It leads to a shift of the maxima to low frequencies for the core segment in comparison with the maxima for peripheral segments. The contribution of local reorientation can also be significant, and in some cases this contribution manifests as an additional maximum. The nontrivial scaling laws in the frequency dependences of dielectric permittivity and NMR relaxation rate averaged over all layers of a dendrimer macromolecule are found.

abstract = {We present results of Monte Carlo study of the monomer–monomer correlation functions, static structure factor, and asphericity characteristics of a single homopolymer in the coil and globular states for three distinct architectures of the chain: ring, open, and star. To rationalize the results we introduce the dimensionless correlation functions rescaled via the corresponding mean-squared distances between monomers. For flexible chains with some architectures these functions exhibit a large degree of universality by falling onto a single or several distinct master curves. In the repulsive regime, where a stretched exponential times a power law form (de Cloizeaux scaling) can be applied, the corresponding exponents $\delta$ and $\theta$ have been obtained. The exponent $\delta$=1/$\nu$ is found to be universal for flexible strongly repulsive coils and in agreement with the theoretical prediction from improved higher-order Borel-resummed renormalization group calculations. The short-distance exponents $\theta$ v of an open flexible chain are in a good agreement with the theoretical predictions in the strongly repulsive regime also. However, increasing the Kuhn length in relation to the monomer size leads to their fast crossover towards the Gaussian behavior. Likewise, a strong sensitivity of various exponents $\theta$ ij on the stiffness of the chain, or on the number of arms in star polymers, is observed. The correlation functions in the globular state are found to have a more complicated oscillating behavior and their degree of universality has been reviewed. Average shapes of the polymers in terms of the asphericity characteristics, as well as the universal behavior in the static structure factors, have been also investigated.},

By applying this theory to concentrated dendrimer solutions we calculate theoretical structure factors and compare them with experimental ones, derived from a detailed analysis of SANS-data.

We have used the self-consistent field approximation to analyze the practically useful (but analytically untractable) case of moderately long melt chains and moderately stretched grafted chains. We have confirmed previous analyses of concentration profiles, but we have also arrived at new features by looking in a systematic way at the interaction energy between two grafted surfaces: (i) we have found a general scaling criterion that an entropic attraction between two such surfaces exists if sigma root N {\textgreater} (N/P)(2), which differs from predictions obtained for very stretched brushes; (ii) this work also demonstrates the existence of an attraction for sparsely grafted layers (sigma root N {\textless} 1) provided that P is large enough. These subtle entropic effects should be of direct consequence for "macroscopic" phenomena such as wetting of protected surfaces and colloidal stabilization.},

Two different models for the connectivity and steric interactions between the monomers are employed, the first one being purely entropic in nature and the second explicitly involving energetic interactions. We find that the effective potentials have a generic Gaussian shape, whose range and strength can be tuned via modifications in the generation number and flexibility of the spacers. We supplement our simulation analysis by a density-functional approach in which the connectivity between the monomers is approximated by an external confining potential that holds the monomer beads together. Using a simple density functional for the interactions between the monomers, we find semiquantitative agreement between theory and simulation. The implications of our findings for the interpretation of scattering data from concentrated dendrimer solutions are also discussed.},

Such a strategy offers a step-by-step control of the growing process, so that the building blocks contg. different metals and/or ligands can be introduced at each step. Each dendrimer can be viewed as an ordered ensemble of weakly interacting [M(L)n(BL)3-n]2+ units (M = Ru(II), Os(II); L = 2,2'-bipyridine, 2,3- or 2,5-dipyridylpyrazine). The absorption bands and the electrochem. properties of each unit are only slightly perturbed in the assembled structure, so that the absorption spectrum and redox pattern of a dendrimer resemble the sum of the spectra and redox pattern the constituent units. The synthetic control translates into a high degree of control of the electrochem. behavior, light absorption properties, and direction of energy transfer. The dendrimers can be used to perform valuable functions such as light harvesting, a fundamental property for solar energy conversion, and reversible exchange (storage and release) of a controlled no. of electrons at a certain potential. 35 Refs.

The charge in the annealed A block depends on both the pH and the added 1:1 electrolyte concentration s. Beyond the cmc, the diblock copolymers form either low aggregation number starlike or large aggregation number crew-cut micelles. A nonmonotonic behavior of the micellar properties as a function of s for fixed pH is found. For starlike micelles, the scaling of the aggregation number Nagg with s is in fair agreement with analytical predictions, i.e., Nagg s0.7-0.9. For the core radius, we find that Rcore s0.24-0.3, and for the corona thickness Tcorona s-0.08. For crew-cut micelles, the scaling exponents deviate significantly from analytical predictions. Upon increasing pH, a smooth transition from crew-cut to starlike micelles happens at high s. Interestingly, a coexistence between these two different micellar sizes is possible for relatively low values of s in a narrow pH range. The corresponding thermodynamics, phase diagram, and various structural properties are presented.},

abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulations, the forces acting on nanoparticles inside polymer brushes are computed. Vertical force profiles are obtained under variation of grafting density, nanoparticle (NP) size, solvent quality, and degree of polydispersity. The force profiles are integrated to obtain the inclusion free energies. If the NP size is fixed, this energy scales with the osmotic pressure, consistent with current theoretical models. These models also predict a scaling of the free energy proportional to the volume of the NP, which is verified in good solvent and at high densities. Otherwise, the power exponent remains lower, and surface tension as a possible cause for the observed deviation is discussed. Polydispersity is shown to reduce the inclusion free energy, while the power law scaling as a function of NP size remains unchanged. Finally, polymer brushes in Theta;-solvent are shown to violate simple scaling predictions within the density regime covered in this work. Using a Flory-Huggins mean-field model, we demonstrate that the universal scaling regime is restricted to very low grafting densities below $\sigma$ = 0.01, and the observed deviations are a result of higher order contributions to the virial expansion of the osmotic pressure. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {This contribution proposes the present day picture of dendrimers as a transition from a non-compact sphere to a dense space filling hyperbolic topology, which contradicts the existing perception of a dendrimer with a dense core and open periphery. The unusual maximum in the generation dependent intrinsic viscosity is analyzed within the framework of the optimized Rouse-Zimm theory with excluded volume interactions between the nearest non-bonded monomers. The position of this maximum represents the onset of this structural transition, which is accompanied by a change in the overall shape, characterized by a cross-over from the Euclidean to non-Euclidean dimensions. This structural transition is a characteristic feature of the topology of dendrimers. The actual available volume is a discontinuous function of generation, rather than a continuous cubic power-law in three dimensions. This implies that the core of dendrimers are dense, while the terminal groups are distributed throughout the core and periphery. Hence, large dendrimers, which are extremely dense objects with highly crowded peripheries exhibit fractal nature with a fractal dimension greater than 3.},

abstract = {We examine the structure of densely grafted polymer layers grown from the surfaces of spherical nanoparticles over a broad range of graft densities and chain lengths. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments show that the hydrodynamic thickness of the polymer layer, h, scales as h ∝ N4/5 for short chains and high grafting densities, that is, in the concentrated polymer brush (CPB) regime, whereas h ∝ N3/5 for long enough chains (semidilute polymer brush, SDPB). The mean field theory of Wijmans and Zhulina is able to collapse approximately all of our data and those in the existing literature (even on other polymers) into an apparently universal form. From these findings, we conclude that the result h ∝ N4/5 for the CPB is an intermediate crossover scaling, relevant to particles of finite curvature, analogous to the h ∝ N observed for concentrated flat brushes. Second, the scaling h ∝ N3/5 uniquely reflects the increased space available to the chain segments as one proceeds away from a curved grafting sur...},

abstract = {Intramolecular structures in amphiphilic graft copolymers with hydrophilic side chains and hydrophobic backbone have been studied by molecular dynamics simulations. In accordance with earlier theoretical predictions [Borisov, O.; Zhulina, E. Macromolecules 2005, 38, 2506-2514], we have found that balance of repulsive and attractive intramolecular interactions may result in the pearl-necklace-type conformations. The globular “pearls” are formed by collapsed segments of the main chain comprising multiple spacers; these pearls are stabilized against aggregation by repulsive interactions of the hydrophilic grafts. The size of the pearls is controlled by the intramolecular hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance, whereas the total number of pearls in the graft copolymer depends on the length of the main chain. For graft copolymer with relatively long spacers we have observed intramolecular conformational transition from pearl-necklace structure to unimolecular cylindrical micelle upon a decrease in the solvent quality for the main chain. The results of simulations, in particular behavior of polymers of finite chain length, are rationalized on the basis of revised and extended scaling theory.},

Dendrimers have proved themselves to be very challenging and applicative; as the structure provides high degree of surface functionality, versatility and the unique properties like uniform size, high degree of branching, multivalency, water solubility, well defined molecular weight and also the available internal cavities. The ability of this macromolecule to construct a definite architectural design of dendrimers with respect to size and shape, length of branching, density, and its well defined molecular structure and segmented spherical construction has opened a wide area of research by understanding the interactions taking place between the biological entities. This review cover a few basic information of dendrimers and much about their possible applications in various areas such as biomedical field, as imaging contrast agents, therapeutic agent, diagnostic agent, gene transfection, drug delivery, targeted drug delivery, solubility enhancer, light harvesting, catalyst, additives, printing ink, paints, biomimics, and many other areas of science.

abstract = {Enantioselection in a stoichiometric or catalytic reaction is governed by small increments of free enthalpy of activation, and such transformations are thus in principle suited to assessing "dendrimer effects" which result from the immobilization of molecular catalysts. Chiral dendrimer catalysts, which possess a high level of structural regularity, molecular monodispersity and well-defined catalytic sites, have been generated either by attachment of achiral complexes to chiral dendrimer structures or by immobilization of chiral catalysts to non-chiral dendrimers. As monodispersed macromolecular supports they provide ideal model systems for less regularly structured but commercially more viable supports such as hyperbranched polymers, and have been successfully employed in continuous-flow membrane reactors. The combination of an efficient control over the environment of the active sites of multi-functional catalysts and their immobilization on an insoluble macromolecular support has resulted in the synthesis of catalytic dendronized polymers. In these, the catalysts are attached in a well-defined way to the dendritic sections, thus ensuring a well-defined microenvironment which is similar to that of the soluble molecular species or at least closely related to the dendrimer catalysts themselves.},

@article{Hajizadeh2014,
abstract = {We present nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation results for the miscibility, structural properties, and melt rheological behavior of polymeric blends under shear flow. The polymeric blends consist of chemically identical linear polymer chains (187 monomers per chain) and dendrimer polymers of generations g = 1-4. The number fraction x of the dendrimer species is varied (4{\%}, 8{\%}, and 12{\%}) in the blend melt. The miscibility of blend species is measured, using the pair distribution functions gDL, gLL, and gDD. All the studied systems form miscible blend melts under the conditions investigated. We also study the effect of shear rate $\gamma$̇ and dendrimer generation on inter-penetration between blend species for different blend systems. The results reveal that shear flow increases the interpenetration of linear chains toward the core of the dendrimers. We also calculate the shear-rate dependent radius of gyration and ratios of the eigenvalues of the gyration tensor to study the shear-induced deformation of the molecules in the blend. Melt rheological properties including the shear viscosity and first and second normal stress coefficients obtained from NEMD simulations at constant pressure are found to fall into the range between those of pure dendrimer and pure linear polymer melts.},

abstract = {Tuning of surface properties plays an important role in applications ranging from material engineering to biomedicine/chemistry. The interactions of chains grafted to a solid support and exposed to a matrix of chemically identical chains represent an intriguing issue. In this work, the behavior of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains grafted irreversibly onto an amorphous silica and immersed in the matrix of free PEO chains of different polymerization degree is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The density distributions of grafted and free PEO chains, the height of the grafted layer, overlap parameters, and orientation order parameters depend not only on the grafting density but also on the length of free chains which confirm the entropic nature of the interactions between the grafted and free chains. In order to achieve a complete expulsion of the free chains from the grafted layer, a grafting density as high as 3.5 nm–2 is necessary. Free PEO chains of 9 monomers leave the grafted layer at lowe...},

@article{Murat1996,
abstract = {The properties of dendrimers (''starburst'' molecules) under varying solvent conditions are studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The dendrimers are found to have a compact (space filling) structure under all solvent conditions, with a radius of gyration which scales with the number of monomers as R(G) proportional to N-1/3. For high generation number dendrimers, there is a distinct region of constant monomer density. The density in this region depends only on the solvent quality and is independent of the generation number. When the contributions of the different generations to the overall density profile are separated, we find that the monomers which belong to the first few generations are stretched and spatially localized. Later generations are less localized and penetrate well into the central regions of the dendrimer. The different primary branches (''dendrons'') of the dendrimers are found to be segregated. The amount of spatial overlap between the different dendrons decreases with increasing generation number of the dendrimer and increasing solvent quality. The relaxation times of the fluctuations of the internal structure were evaluated as well, to ensure that the simulations were run long enough for adequate sampling.},
